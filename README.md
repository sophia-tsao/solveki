# Solveki

Solveki is a math practice web app. It serves an endless deck of auto-generated
math problems organized into courses and topics, checks answers, and lets each
signed-in user pick which topics they want to practice.

Problems are produced by [mathgenerator](https://github.com/lukew3/mathgenerator),
a library of parameterized math-problem generators, vendored under the backend.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 20+
- A Google OAuth client ID (sign-in uses Google)

## Getting started

### Backend (Django, port 8000)

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .                   # installs deps from pyproject.toml
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py seed_topics       # load topics
python manage.py seed_courses      # create courses and link the topics to them
python manage.py runserver
```

Configuration is read from environment variables or a `backend/.env` file
(git-ignored). At minimum set the Google OAuth client ID:

```
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
```

### Frontend (React + Vite, port 5173)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Set the backend URL in `frontend/.env`:

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

The Vite dev server (`:5173`) talks to Django (`:8000`) with credentialed
requests, so the backend allows that origin via CORS.

## API

The backend exposes a small JSON API under the app's URLs, including:

- `POST /auth/google/`, `GET /auth/me/`, `POST /auth/logout/` — authentication
- `GET /problem/` — generate a problem
- `GET /deck/`, `POST /deck/advance/` — the daily practice deck
- `GET /courses/`, `GET /courses/<id>/topics`, `POST /topics/<id>/select` — course/topic selection
- `GET|POST /settings/` — user settings

See [backend/myapp/urls.py](backend/myapp/urls.py) for the full list. The
[bruno/](bruno/) collection contains ready-to-run requests against these
endpoints.

## Testing

- **Backend unit tests:** `cd backend && python manage.py test`
- **Frontend unit tests (Vitest):** `cd frontend && npm test`
- **End-to-end tests (Playwright):** see below.

### End-to-end tests

Playwright specs in [frontend/e2e/](frontend/e2e/) drive a real browser through
the full stack — the built React SPA against a live Django API — covering the
login gate, course/topic selection, the daily deck flow, and settings.

Because sign-in is Google-OAuth-only (which can't run headless), the suite
authenticates through a **test-only** endpoint, `POST /auth/test-login/`. It
logs in a fixed test user and is gated behind the `ENABLE_TEST_LOGIN` setting:
it returns **404 unless `ENABLE_TEST_LOGIN=1`**, so it can never be reached in a
normal or production run. Each call also resets that user's practice state
(selections, deck, settings) so tests start from a clean slate.

Run locally:

```bash
# 1. Backend with the test-login endpoint enabled (after migrate + seed).
cd backend
ENABLE_TEST_LOGIN=1 python manage.py runserver 8000

# 2. In another terminal: run the E2E suite. Playwright builds and serves the
#    SPA on :5173 itself (the origin the backend's CORS allows).
cd frontend
npm run test:e2e            # headless
npm run test:e2e:ui         # interactive UI mode for debugging
npx playwright show-report  # open the HTML report after a run
```

The suite runs on every pull request via
[.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml](.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml).
