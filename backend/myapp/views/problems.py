# NOTE: ``mathgenerator`` and the local ``..generators`` package are imported
# lazily inside the functions below, not at module top level. Importing them
# costs ~1s+, and — inflated by Cloud Run's throttled single vCPU during a cold
# start — that import is the single largest slice of cold-start latency. Only
# problem generation needs them; the URLconf load that every request (including
# the trivial /auth/me/) pays for does not. Deferring the import moves that cost
# off the cold-start path and onto the first /problem/ (or /deck/) request.

# Matches an *over-precise* decimal (4+ fractional digits) anywhere in a string,
# e.g. the ``523.5987755982989`` inside ``"523.5987755982989 m^3"``. Decimals
# already at three or fewer places are left exactly as written, so a generator's
# intentional formatting (``5.0*10^4``, ``46.7``) is never disturbed — only the
# long floats some library generators emit get normalised. A leading sign is
# captured so negatives round correctly.
