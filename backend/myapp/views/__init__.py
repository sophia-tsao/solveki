"""HTTP views for myapp, split by concern.

This package used to be a single ``views.py``. It's kept importable as
``myapp.views`` with the same public surface, so ``urls.py`` and the test
suite need no changes. New code should import from the specific submodule
(e.g. ``from myapp.views.deck import _generate_problems``); the re-exports below
exist for backwards compatibility.
"""

# Re-exported so tests can patch ``myapp.views.mathgenerator`` and
# ``myapp.views.google_id_token`` (mock.patch resolves the module object here,
# and the submodules reference the same object).
