"""Solveki-local problem generators.

These extend the stock ``mathgenerator`` library with generators we maintain
ourselves. ``_make_problem`` resolves a name here first, then falls back to
``mathgenerator``.

To add a generator: write a function returning ``(problem, solution)`` in the
appropriate category module and decorate it with ``@register``. Then import
that module below so its registration runs. The contract test in
``test_generators.py`` automatically covers every registered generator.
