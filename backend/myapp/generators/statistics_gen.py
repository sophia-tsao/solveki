"""Solveki-local statistics / data-analysis generators.

These cover the computable gaps in Georgia's "Statistical Reasoning" course
and the data-analysis strands of Algebra. Every generator here is named with a
``stat_`` prefix, takes no required arguments, and returns a ``(problem,
solution)`` pair of LaTeX strings. Problem statements are written to be
regex-parseable (datasets are rendered as e.g. ``data set: 3, 7, 1, 9, 4``) so
the math-correctness tests can recover the inputs and recompute the answer.
