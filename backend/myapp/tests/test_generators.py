"""Contract tests between the seed data and the available generators.

These do NOT test the correctness of a third-party generator's math (that is
mathgenerator's responsibility). They assert only that every generator_name
the seed data relies on is a real generator that returns a (problem, solution)
pair — guarding against a library upgrade or a typo silently breaking a topic.
_make_problem resolves a name via LOCAL_GENERATORS then getattr(mathgenerator,
name); a name that no longer exists would otherwise surface as a 500 for a
student.

Local generators (ones we maintain) get a stronger determinism check in
LocalGeneratorTests, since their logic *is* our responsibility.
